## 🌍 Overview

**CommunityHostels.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform dedicated to **community-driven or community-managed hostels**—places where the hostel isn’t just a place to sleep, but a gateway into:

- local culture  
- neighborhood life  
- language, food, music, and rituals  
- real human connection  
- authentic, grounded travel  

This is not a generic hostel directory.  
It is a **culture-first hostel discovery platform**.

CommunityHostels highlights hostels that are:
- locally owned and embedded  
- culturally meaningful  
- socially designed  
- welcoming without being exploitative  
- safe, inclusive, and respectful  

---

## 🎯 Core Idea

Most hostels optimize for:
- price  
- beds  
- party  

CommunityHostels optimizes for:
> **local experience + community + belonging**

It answers:
- *Where can I stay that actually feels like this place?*
- *Where will I meet locals and travelers in a healthy way?*
- *Where is the hostel part of the neighborhood, not separate from it?*

---

## 🧠 What “Community-Driven” Means (Non-Negotiable)

A hostel can only be listed if it demonstrates at least **3** of the following:

### ⭐ Core Signals
- locally owned (not purely corporate)
- employs local staff meaningfully
- supports local artists or makers
- hosts cultural programming (food, music, workshops)
- creates ethical community interaction (not poverty tourism)
- partners with local organizations
- provides local learning opportunities
- respects neighborhood noise and impact
