                    <p class="section-subtitle">When travelers choose community hostels, they create real impact — for neighborhoods, local economies, and their own understanding of the world.</p>
                </div>

                        <h3>Revenue Stays Local</h3>
                        <p>Community hostels are locally owned. Your booking supports neighborhood families, not corporate shareholders. Money stays in the community.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">100% of profits go directly to local owners and staff.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="impact-icon">🤝</div>
                        <h3>Real Local Jobs</h3>
                        <p>Community hostels employ locals meaningfully — as managers, hosts, and cultural guides. Not just housekeeping, but leadership roles.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">Average 8-12 local staff per hostel</p>

                        <h3>Support Local Creators</h3>
                        <p>Community hostels partner with local artists, musicians, chefs, and makers. Hosting their work, paying them fairly, and giving them a platform.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">50+ local creators partnered per city</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Preservation</h3>
                        <p>By choosing cultural hostels, travelers help preserve authentic neighborhoods. Less gentrification pressure, more respect for local traditions and values.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">Neighborhoods with cultural tourism grow 3x slower than commercialized areas</p>

                        <h3>Real Learning</h3>
                        <p>Community hostels create meaningful exchange. Travelers don't just consume culture — they learn, question assumptions, and build empathy.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">85% of travelers report deeper cultural understanding</p>

                        <p>Community-first tourism doesn't exhaust neighborhoods. It builds slowly, respects capacity, and thinks long-term about what communities can sustain.</p>
                        <p class="impact-stat">Average 1-2 new community hostels per city annually</p>

                            <p>A community hostel is a locally owned accommodation that goes beyond just providing a bed. It's embedded in its neighborhood, employs local staff, hosts cultural programming like cooking nights, music sessions, and walking tours, and creates authentic connections between travelers and local culture. Unlike standard hostels that optimize for price or party, community hostels optimize for local experience, community, and belonging.</p>
